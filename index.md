# Classifying Streaming Providers inside a VPN

## Research Question: Can we identify what streaming service provider is being used across a VPN tunnel? How does adding live video affect the model classification? 



### When might this information be used?
When it comes to classifying which streaming service provider is being used in a VPN, there are many reasons to collect it. In working with Viasat, their goal as an Internet Service Provider is to offer the best quality experience for their customers. So if they set certain network parameters in place, such as max download rates, certain providers could be more heavily affected. By studying the network patterns of some different service providers and making a tool to classify them, this information can be used to help tune network parameters to optimize streaming for their clients. 


### Key Terms!
